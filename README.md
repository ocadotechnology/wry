# Wry [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ocadotechnology/wry.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ocadotechnology/wry)

A Pythonic AMT provisioning, configuration and management library.

It is [very] loosely based on the OpenStack Ironic project, hence the name.

## OK, but what is AMT?

Intel AMT is a remote management technology, widely implemented in modern Intel
chipsets, and often advertised under the 'vPro' marketing tag.

It provides functionality such as:

- Remote power control
- Remote control via Serial-over-LAN and VNC
- Packet filtering
- Arbitary key/value data storage in NVRAM

AMT is implemented in BMC firmware and is, thus, operating-system independent.

See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Active_Management_Technology) for more information.

## Quickstart

Wry's functionality is exposed through the AMTDevice class. Initialize it as such:

    >>> from wry import AMTDevice
    >>> dev = AMTDevice(address, False, username, password)

You can then access different apects of device functionality, through aspect-specific namespaces. For example:

    >>> dev.power.turn_on()
    >>> dev.power.state
    StateMap(state='on', sub_state=None)

## Documentation

Full documentation can be found on [readthedocs](http://wry.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

## Status
Wry is in the early stages of development, and the interfaces it exposes may change as a result. Issues and pull requests are more than welcome.

Wry currently supports only Python 2.7. There are no philosophical reasons for this; it simply matches our target environment. Patches to support other platforms are welcome.

## Compatibility

Wry relies on the wsman AMT protocol, and therefore supports AMT versions 7(?) onwards.

Tested on the following hardware/firmware:

- `Intel NUC DC53427HYE (BIOS 0037, ME 8.1.40.1416)`
- `Intel NUC5i5MYBE`
